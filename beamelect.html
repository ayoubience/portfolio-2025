				<h2 class="sec-title mb-50">The Vision and the Foundation</h2> <!--'The Sound and the Fury' by William Faulkner-->
				<p>In Q3 2021, the design team wanted to explore a vision of what would plant the seeds that would eventually sprout into BeamElect, without knowing that at the time. What would a self-contained experience look, feel, and flow like, where an employee can learn and understand their insurance options before choosing? Fast-forward exactly 2 years, and Beam had the appetite to go all-in on this concept. our research showed that:</p>

						<p>of time spent on administrative tasks for benefit enrollments could be spent on other priorities</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="mb-50">During our Q3 2023 onsite, the team partook in a hackathon to put together a quick proof-of-concept:</p>

				<p>As the lead designer, I wanted to dig more deeply into this exploration; there were elements that resembled a similar project I had worked on the year before that required listing out benefit details and the ability to choose coverage for employees. Could there be an opportunity to repeat some of the UI patterns for design and development?</p>

					<h2 class="sec-title mb-50">A Tale of Two ‘Verticals’</h2> <!--'A Tale of Two Cities' by Charles Dickens-->
					<p class="mb-10">
						Phase 1 of realizing BeamElect was to build out the 'member benefit elections' experience, where an employee chooses what plan they want for each offered insurance line (or to waive coverage).
						<br><br>
						Through the first few iterative mobile design explorations I conducted, the project stakeholders and I agreed that the card patterns I recycled from prior work was not relevant or detailed enough to help the average person decide on enrolling in coverage. It would take much more context-setting and knowledge-sharing to get to that point. As such, it made sense to split the work for this phase into two parallel efforts:
					</p>
					<ul class="text-light-bg pt-20 mb-50">
						<li class="mb-10">enhance enrollment experience flow by breaking up plan selection across multiple pages to minimize cognitive overload</li>
						<li class="mb-10">UI and content design for insurance plan cards so employees <em class="fontswap-sans">know</em> what benefits they are getting and paying for</li>

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p class="mt-50">While running point on the enrollment experience flow redesign, I partnered with our UX Director and lead UX Researcher on content and UI design for the plan cards, with the main Product Manager and Software Engineers on technical considerations, and with our Compliance and Insurance Product teams to ensure all language accurately reflects what we're offering to businesses. For BeamElect's first launch, we needed to have cards for the following insurance products:</p>
					<div class="flex-container">
						<div class="flex-item">
							<ul class="text-light-bg">
								<li>dental</li>
								<li>vision</li>
								<li>supplemental life</li>

						</div>
						<div class="flex-item">
							<ul class="text-light-bg">
								<li>accident</li>
								<li>critical illness</li>
								<li>hospital indemnity</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Through a collaborative UX team effort, we explored potential plan card designs, and I took the design set we agreed on to further refine for adding back into the benefit selection mockups:</p>
					<!--tab content!-->
					<div class="tabs mtb-50">
						<input type="radio" name="tabs" id="tabone" checked="checked">

						</div>
					</div>					
					<p>Although we wanted to include a 'Common questions' tab in the card design, UX and Engineering agreed to scrap UI and content development due to time/prioritization and technical constraints, and leaned into the 2-tab card design that displays basic plan information and coverage details. The 'What's covered' tab would borrow heavily from Beam's own plan documents (specifically, benefit summaries) to fill in the relevant information. Below is how I organized plan card designs and content for each insurance line for the engineering team:</p>
					<img class="mtb-50" src="img/beamelect/final-plan-card-direction.png" alt="final design sample of the plan cards, including what the 'benefits' and 'what's covered' tabs look like, what content they include, and the unselected vs selected states">
					<p>Plugging these cards back into the benefit selection flow, phase 1 designs were in a good spot for the engineering team to start development, while I partnered with our research team to begin phase 2: "guided enrollment."</p>

				<h2 class="sec-title mb-50">Do Employees Dream of Understanding Insurance?</h2> <!--'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' by Philip K Dick-->
				<p>Language is a fascinating tool for communication, and when used correctly, can instill a sense of trust and confidence, especially when making decisions. However, insurance language tends to do the opposite, instilling confusion and uncertainty when employees make their selections. This gap in communication leads to more "no"s without employees knowing for sure what insurance they're declining and why:</p>
				<ul class="text-light-bg pt-30 mb-30">
					<li class="mb-10"><em>We speak a foreign language.</em> How many people <em class="fontswap-sans">actually</em> know what "coinsurance," "deductible," and all the various "-dontists" are? Very good chance that not many do.</li>
					<li class="mb-10"><em>We lead with technical info and not value.</em> Coverage percentages and "maximums" feel abstract next to how much a visit or procedure costs with vs without a relevant insurance plan.</li>
					<li><em>We fail to connect to real life.</em> Practical examples and stories always connect with people more than plan facts/details.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mb-50">And Beam's research drives these points home:</p>
				<!--chart start (script is below)-->
				<div id="main-barchart-container">
					<h5 class="center-align fontswap-serif mb-10">More or better info about benefits would have convinced me to enroll</h5>
					<div id="barchart-container">
						<canvas id="barchart"></canvas>
					</div>
				</div>
				<!--chart end (script is below)-->
				<p class="mt-50">The 29% of people across over 50 companies who responded 'Agree' to this question scales to nearly <b style="background-color: #FBF719;">$4 million</b> in additional revenue if we improve communication about our insurance products. How might we do that? By:</p>
				<ul class="text-light-bg pt-30 mb-30">
					<li class="mb-10">talking about coverage using <em>real world scenarios</em> people can likely experience</li>
					<li class="mb-10">demonstrating <em>examples of the dollar value</em> of having vs not having insurance</li>
					<li><em>defining insurance concepts</em> to provide context and not assuming knowledge</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Simple enough, but how would we apply these ideas to create a final product? At this point, the research team and I gathered people from across all business functions (design, product, engineering, sales, partnerships) together to host a co-creation workshop with the main business goal being to <b>bridge the communication gap between employees and our products to increase enrollment rates across all available insurance lines.</b> We accomplished this by breaking into teams and:</p>
				<ol class="text-light-bg pt-30 mb-50">
					<li class="mb-10">analyzing some competitors' approaches to benefits enrollment guides</li>
					<li class="mb-10">storyboarding and sharing ideas in a general carousel format</li>

				<p class="mt-50">Now, why a carousel? We considered it the best approach to ensure brevity and clarity without using much digital real estate, especially when considering smaller devices.

						<p>I wanted to ensure everything fits without needing to vertically scroll.

				<p>I strongly advocated for content to follow a <em class="fontswap-sans"><b>'here's why you need this, with an example of how it works'</b></em> tone. Understanding insurance is scary enough as it is, more so with the 'you should buy this (with an implied “or else”)' approach. Even without a dedicated content designer, as a writer (by hobby) I know the power of tone and voice. I led iterative efforts to ensure the language matched the vision. The best way to get there was, of course, to test, refine with the guidance of our compliance and insurance product teams, re-test, and refine some more!</p>

				<p>To build off of BeamElect's success for open enrollment season 2024, we scoped in time to explore and build more insurance product offerings into the experience:</p>
				<ul class="text-light-bg pt-30 mb-30">
					<li  class="mb-10">Disability insurance (short and long term plans)</li>
					<li>Medical insurance plans</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-20">Implementing disability insurance options was also a business need at the time as part of <a href="https://www.beambenefits.com/articles/introducing-beam-disability-powered-by-the-hartford" target="_blank"><b><u>Beam's partnership with The Hartford</u></b></a>, so the timing was serendipitous <!--(The Hartford's press release is <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-release-details/2023/The-Hartford-Enhances-Employee-Benefits-For-Small-Businesses-Through-New-Relationship-With-Beam-Benefits/default.aspx" target="_blank"><b><u>here</u></b></a>)-->. As with the current BeamElect experience, both disability insurance lines needed their respective sets of plan cards, carousels, and plan selection screens.
					<br><br>I recycled the UI for these elements, and the plan card information would be built off the benefit summaries from the backend. Fortunately, both products were similar enough that designing carousel content for one meant designing most of the content for the other.</p>
				<img src="img/beamelect/disabilitylines.png" class="mtb-50" alt="high-fidelity designs for short & long term disability carousel and plan selection screens"
					data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-once="true">
				<p class="mb-20">For medical plan selection design, I needed only to focus on restructuring the plan cards to accommodate for medical plan information. This is because the planned backend work would need to read medical plan documents, which are fundamentally different than all of the other plan documents Beam handles.</p>

				<p>Essentially, businesses would provide Beam with their medical plan documents. Next, we would convert these documents in the backend to .JSON files (for easier data transfer) and work with them to confirm all data appears accurate. Then, that data would be fed into the organization's BeamElect process, after which employees can enroll in all available benefit lines.</p>

				<p>As of summer 2025, the medical plan addition to BeamElect was deprioritized due to other more time-sensitive initiatives. Still, this direction will take BeamElect one step closer to being a true one-stop-shop for smaller businesses to enroll their employees in insurance benefits.</p>
