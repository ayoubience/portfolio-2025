# A Y O U B I E N C E Portfolio - 2025

My portfolio, showcasing product design work/experience, writing/publishing, and other artistic endeavors.

This is a mid-to-large overhaul of my prior UX portfolio that I built out back in 2020/2021, featuring:

>(1) updated brand font usage (for simplicity) and colors (for improved WCAG accessibility)

>(2) much more exploration into:
>- animation
>- chart implementation
>- carousels
>- tabs
>- multiple overlay modals on a single page
>- new back-to-top function with progress indicator built-in

>(3) generally more simplified navigation (only "Work" is a dropdown on hover)
>- removed dedicated "Contact" page (it only attracted spam)
>- added link to resume directly in my navbar

>(4) revamped/rewritten "About" page, new "Writing" page, updated "Art" to "Playground"
>- poetry removed from "Playground" and merged into "Writing," which also features my book and other publications
>- "About" includes how to contact me, as well as link to resume

Below will be any version notes, to-dos, etc.
